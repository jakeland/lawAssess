A technical assessment

This was a fun project I got to do right before Covid destroyed the year 2020. 
The project consisted of using a single jpeg image to create a website in order to prove I knew how to code and could take tasks to completion with minimal oversight. 

The best part of it was that I was not given a layered Image, so I couldn't isolate componants, such as the image with a green transparent box over it.
Because of this, I was able to prove myself by not only finding the original image, 
but editing it into the proper format, and adding it to the site, which landed me a position at lawyer.com :+1:
