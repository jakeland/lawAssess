A technical assessment

This was a fun project I got to do right before Covid destroyed the year 2020. 

The best part of it was that I was given an image that was incomplete, and an effect that was unable to be created just from the visual guide provided. 

Because of this, I was able to prove myself by not only finding the original image, but editing it into the proper format, and adding it to the site, which landed me a position at lawyer.com
